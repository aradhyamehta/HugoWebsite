# About Me

Hello! I'm Aradhya and have been working as a [Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) based in Mumbai, India. Within the field of software engineering, I am working on enterprise based web applications, usually working on the backend. I have recently started learning more about devops and deployment processes.

In order to be able to learn new technologies, I usually work on small side projects to keep up with skills. I've been working on a [bug tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) to track all of the technical issues that I encounter during my personal work. I also maintain [summaryofcs.com](http://www.summaryofcs.com), which is my experience of all the technical books, interviews and problem solving approaches that I've encountered. You can check out some of my other projects in the [Projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) section.
